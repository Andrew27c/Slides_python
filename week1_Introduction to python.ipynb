    "Almost all of the code you'll see can be run on all three of the major operating systems: Windows, MacOS, and Linux, as well as in free online notebooks provided by Google (this service is called Google Colab).\n",
    "\n",
    "If you haven't yet decided which operating system to use, this book recommends either Linux or MacOS because, in a very small number of cases, you'll find it easier to run the most advanced code on them rather than on Windows. Don't panic if you have Windows already though-most things will work just fine and it tends to be power users who run into this problem. (If you're not familiar with Linux, it's a free operating system that is also widely used for cloud services and, while it used to  have a reputation as being fearsomely difficult for beginners, some modern Linux distributions, such as Ubuntu, are pretty user-friendly.)\n",
    "\n",
    "If you have Windows and you want to use Linux or Mac but don't want to shell out for a new computer, there are a couple of options. One is to use the [*Windows Subsystem for Linux*](https://pbpython.com/wsl-python.html). It's essentially a Linux operating system that installs alongside and integrates with your existing Windows operating system. This allows you to run code as if you were using Linux. You can get WSL [for free from Microsoft](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10) (the fact that Microsoft has included this feature speaks to the demand for it). Another option is to use [Github Codespaces](https://github.com/features/codespaces), which gives cheap (but not free) access to a pre-built Linux machine in the cloud. A further option is [Gitpod](https://www.gitpod.io/), which is like Codespaces but has a generous free tier.\n",

    "### Choice of Programming Language\n",
    "\n",
    "We use Python, which is usually ranked as the first or second most popular programming language in the world and, just as importantly, it's also one of the easiest to learn. It's a general purpose language, which means it can perform a wide range of tasks. This combination of features is why people say Python has a low floor and a high ceiling. It's also very versatile; the joke goes that Python is the 2nd best language at everything, and there's some truth to that (although Python is 1st best at some tasks, like machine learning). But a language that covers such a lot of ground is also very useful; and Python is widely used across industry, academia, and the public sector, and is often taught in school computer science classes too. Python is the main 'dynamic' language used at [Google](https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html) and the [most demanded language](https://insights.dice.com/2020/12/01/7-programming-languages-popular-at-apple-that-could-land-you-a-job/) in jobs for Apple. It is used for everything from computer games to websites, data science to software applications: it's even being used to help [fly a helicopter on Mars](https://github.com/nasa/fprime). As a student majoring in economics, you will know that this means Python benefits from strong positive network externalities. As such, learning Python has a lot of value and, once you have, learning more specialised languages like C++ or R is much easier; many of the basic programming concepts you'll see in this book are useful in almost any programming language. One other benefit of Python if you plan to do any work on the cloud is that it is extremely well supported.\n",

    "*Python*, from [xkcd](https://xkcd.com).\n",
    "\n",
    "Different languages have different strengths and weaknesses. Python and Julia are so-called high-level languages that are easier to write code in. C++ and Fortran are more low-level languages and much more fussy and labour-intensive to write code in; but, once the code is written (and 'compiled'), it runs *fast*.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another big difference between languages is the extent to which users have created software that extends the base functionality of the language. The ecosystem of other users, and what they're using the language for, is really important for determining how useful a language is. For example, Python and R have vibrant data science communities producing extensions (called libraries or packages) that are what really make those languages so useful for data science (far more than the base functionality of either).\n",
    "\n",
    "Programming languages come in versions, which can be quite different, and some of the most important functionality of programming languages is provided by add-ons called packages or libraries, which themselves have versions. To make matters worse, not all versions of packages and languages will work together, and the combinations that work may depend on your operating system (Windows, Mac, etc)!\n",
    "\n",
    "The combination of the language and its version (eg Python 3.8), the packages and their versions (eg numpy 1.19), and the operating system the code is being run on (eg MacOS Catalina) is called the computational environment. We use Python 3.8.\n",
    "\n",
    "To programme, you will need two things on your computer:\n",

    "- an installation of the programming language (also known as the \"interpreter\"), for example Python 3.8\n",

This will provide you with a Python installation and a host of the most useful libraries. If you get stuck, there are more detailed instructions available for installing the Anaconda distribution of Python [on Windows](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/windows/), [on Mac](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/mac-os/), and [on Linux](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/linux/).\n",

If you're using Windows, you can check if Anaconda has installed properly by opening the 'Anaconda prompt' (a special text-based way to issue commands to your computer) and type `where python`. You should see a path rendered as text in the prompt that includes \"Anaconda3\", for example something like `C:\\Users\\<your-username>\\Anaconda3\\...`. On Mac and Linux you may need to run `conda init` on your command line to activate your Anaconda Python environment (Mac and Linux usually come with, typically, old versions of Python pre-installed). You can check you've got the right Python with `which python`, which should result in a message back saying `/Users/<your-username>/opt/anaconda3/bin/python`. "

    "### Installing an integrated development environment (IDE)\n",
    "\n",
    "An integrated development environment is a software application that provides a few tools to make coding easier. The most important of these is a way to write the code itself! IDEs are not the only way to programme, but they are perhaps the most useful. If you have used **Stata** or **Matlab**, you may not have realised it, but these package up the language and the IDE together. But they are separate things: the language is a way of processing your instructions, the IDE is where you write those instructions.\n",

We strongly recommends [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), a free and open source IDE from Microsoft that is available on all major operating systems.

As well as Python, Visual Studio Code supports a ton of other languages.\n",

    "Visual Studio Code supports coding in both scripts and Jupyter Notebooks. While scripts mostly contain code (and have file extension `.py`), notebooks can contain text and code in different blocks called cells. 'Jupyter Notebooks' have the file extension '.ipynb'. The name, 'Jupyter', is a reference to the three original languages supported by Jupyter, which are Julia, Python, and R, and to Galileo's notebooks recording the discovery of the moons of Jupiter. Jupyter notebooks now support a vast number of languages beyond the original three, including Ruby, Haskell, Go, Scala, Octave, Java, and [more](https://github.com/jupyter/jupyter/wiki/Jupyter-kernels). There'll be more about the difference between scripts and notebooks later on in the book.\n",
